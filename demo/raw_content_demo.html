# Raw Content Variable Demo

The `@raw_content` variable is now available in plugins built with `jekyll_plugin_support`. 
It provides access to the raw HTML content of the page being processed.

## How to Access @raw_content

In your plugin's `render_impl` method, you can now access `@raw_content`:

```ruby
def render_impl
  if @raw_content
    @logger.debug { "Content length: #{@raw_content.length}" }
    @logger.debug { "Content type: #{@raw_content.class}" }
    # Process the content...
  end
end
```

## Live Demo

The `@raw_content` variable is demonstrated in the `demo_block_tag` plugin below.
The plugin shows information about the content that has been rendered so far:

{% demo_block_tag %}
This is the content within the demo_block_tag block. You can see that the @raw_content variable shows what content has been processed up to this point.
{% enddemo_block_tag %}

## Key Features

- **Access to rendered HTML**: See what content has been generated up to this point
- **Content analysis**: Analyze page structure, length, or specific elements
- **Content modification**: Process or enhance existing content
- **Available in both tags and blocks**: Works in both `JekyllTag` and `JekyllBlock` subclasses

## Use Cases

- **Content validation**: Check if pages meet certain criteria
- **Performance monitoring**: Track content complexity and size
- **Content enhancement**: Add processing based on existing content
- **Content extraction**: Extract specific parts for further processing

This feature enhances plugin capabilities by providing direct access to the content rendering pipeline.
