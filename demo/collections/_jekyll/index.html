<h2 id="about">About This Material</h2>
<p>
  In this corner of my website, I discuss the open-source code
  I wrote (and continue to write) about developing websites generated by Jekyll.
  For this purpose I usually write the following types of code:
  Ruby, bash, HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript; I sometimes use Twitter Bootstrap.
